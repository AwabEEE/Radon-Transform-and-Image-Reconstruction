# Radon-Transform-and-Image-Reconstruction
This lab focuses on the Radon transform, a mathematical technique widely used in computed tomography (CT) for reconstructing 2D images from projection data. The lab is divided into two key parts

# 🧠 Brain Image Reconstruction Lab
This project demonstrates the **Radon Transform and Back Projection** in MATLAB using a brain image. The objective is to generate sinogram data from an image and reconstruct it using different projection angles.

## 📌 Overview

In this lab, we perform **Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction** using the **Radon Transform** and **Inverse Radon Transform** in MATLAB. The process includes:

1. **Generating a sinogram**: Applying the Radon transform to a given brain image.
2. **Reconstructing the image**: Using different projection angles and analyzing the quality of reconstruction.
3. **Visualizing results**: Comparing the original image, sinogram, and reconstructed images.
